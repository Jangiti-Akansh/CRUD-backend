In this project, I developed a backend application using Node.js, Express.js, and MySQL. The backend serves as a RESTful API that interacts with a MySQL database, allowing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the database. The primary focus is on managing data related to a hypothetical 'shops' database.
